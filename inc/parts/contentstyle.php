Pick Your Own Cherries typically begins mid to late June and continues through mid July. The shortest of our PYO seasons, our ‘Bing’ cherries are a relatively large variety and share the characteristic heart-shape that most cherries exhibit. The Bing cherry is intensely sweet and tangy, considered by most to be the ultimate cherry for both flavor and texture. When picking, be sure to look for fruit that is very dark red in color – yellow or pink fruit has not ripened fully and is not ready to pick. Visit us again for updated 2018 PYO pricing as we approach the harvest time and are better able to evaluate this year’s crop.
